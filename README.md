 The Agent License Limit Warning app monitors your Rocket.Chat workspace's license usage in real-time. When a new user is created, it checks the number of active users against your license limit and sends proactive alerts if a predefined threshold is exceeded. Notifications can be directed to specific users via direct message, selected rooms, or external endpointsâ€”ensuring your team stays informed and avoids unexpected service disruptions. Ideal for admins and workspace owners who need to stay compliant and prevent license overages.
